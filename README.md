# Block-Chain-Based-Autonomous-Notarization
In an era where digital transactions and legal agreements are increasingly prevalent, the need for secure, transparent, and efficient notarization systems has never been greater.The proposed system, termed the Blockchain Based Autonomous Notarization System (BANOS), leverages the immutability and transparency of blockchain to provide a decentralized and tamper proof mechanism for notarizing documents. The BANOS system utilizes national eID cards to authenticate users, ensuring that only verified individuals can initiate notarization processes. Once authenticated, users can submit documents for notarization, which are then recorded on a blockchain ledger. Each notarized document is hashed and stored on the blockchain, creating a verifiable and immutable record that can be accessed by relevant parties for validation.
